## 📌 About the Project

**Mapty** is a web application that lets users log their running or cycling workouts by clicking on a map.  
It uses **Leaflet.js** for interactive maps and **localStorage** for data persistence — no backend required.  
Built with **JavaScript**, this project showcases OOP, DOM manipulation, geolocation, and third-party library integration.

This app was developed as part of learning modern JavaScript and architecture patterns.
